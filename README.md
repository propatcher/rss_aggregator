## üöÄ How It Works (Simplified)

1. You **add an RSS feed**
2. The FastAPI app **validates and stores it** in the database  
3. Every hour, a **Celery worker** (via Redis) fetches new articles from all your feeds  
4. New articles are **saved with auto-generated tags** and marked as unread  
5. You **browse your unified feed** via the API:  
   - Search by keyword  
   - Filter by tag  
   - Mark as read  
6. Real-time **analytics** (unread count, top tags) are always available  

All of this happens **without email, without bloat** ‚Äî just clean data and automation.
